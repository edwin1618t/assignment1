Twitter Trending Topics Scraper
This project is a web application that scrapes Twitter for trending topics and presents the data in a user-friendly format. The application uses Selenium for web scraping, Flask for backend functionality, and MongoDB for data storage.

Features://
Web Scraping: Fetches the latest trending topics from Twitter.
Data Storage: Saves the scraped data to a MongoDB database for persistence and future reference.
Dynamic Web Interface: A responsive web page built using HTML and CSS, displaying trends and related metadata.
Reusability: Includes a button to re-run the scraper and refresh the displayed data.

How It Works://
Scraping: The scraper_script.py uses Selenium to navigate Twitter, extract trending topics, and format the data.
Backend: The app.py Flask application handles user requests and fetches data from MongoDB.
Frontend: The interface, built with HTML and CSS, displays the trending topics, query timestamp, and IP address used.
